## Binary-search

Binary-search is a searching algorithm use to search value in sorted array. This algorithm is more performant than linear search

## How binary-search works

- Start by splitting an array in two
- Then check if the middle value find in array is greater or less than the targert(searchin value)
- .... to continue
